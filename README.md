# Eleventy/TailwindCSS base

This is my eleventy tailwind base.

## Running the site in Development

To install all dependencies run `npm install` in the projects directory.
To run the site locally in development use `npm start`. The terminal will output the localhost port, where the site is served.

## Building the website

To build the website for production run `npm run build`.
This will build the website in the `/docs/` folder.
Folder is called docs, so the site can be run on GitHub Pages without further setup.
